# BinaryEx
Fast C# Extension functions for reading or writing binary data.

Easy to use, fast performance, no or very little allocation parsing utilities.

I have benchmarked these extensions extensively using both mono, and .net core to try and get the best performance possible from both runtimes.

I will update the readme with benchmarks between BinaryPrimatives, BitConverter, BinaryReader and BinaryEx once i put the library on nuget.

Not yet on nuget but i plan to publish it soon.
